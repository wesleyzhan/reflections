When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-Keeping things in Cloud nowadays are much more safe in terms of the storing of data.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-As mentioned in lesson 1, manual commits would be much more logical than automatic ones.
